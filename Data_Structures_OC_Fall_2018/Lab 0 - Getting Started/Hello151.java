/**
 * Hello CSCI 151 graders, I am writing to you from the past; currently the date
 * is August 6th. I am completing some of the course work early so that I may
 * explore CSCI 151 more deeply during the coming semester. My schedule this
 * semester is packed and I believe that doing some of the work now may benefit
 * me later on. Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a nice day and
 * enjoyed your summer.
