FILES ENCLOSED
================================================================================
testurl.sh

Tests whether or not the urls in a directory lead to a valid webpage.

backup.sh

Takes directory as argument and copies files, inputting them to the directory.

diskhog.sh

Lists the 5 largest items in the current directory in decreasing magnitude of
size recursively.

linecount.sh

Recursively counts all the lines in all the file of a current directory.

gradeit.sh

Tests for differences between two files; grades diamond.c and rot128.c, which
are stored ~rhoyle/pub/cs241/hw01

================================================================================
ISSUES
================================================================================
1. backup.sh I cannot input files into a directory inside the directory I am
   already in.
2. linecount.sh I do not know whether my program reads blank lines and have not
   tested it nor know whether they should be counted. I believe my program only
   read lines of code.
3. gradeit.sh I do not know whether the "errors" I outputted when the outputs
   did not match are actual errors in my homework or whether they are the result
   of faulty code in gradeit.sh
================================================================================
DATA FILE ANALYSIS
================================================================================
1. There are 21790 "Male" entries and 10771 "Female" entries. To find this I
   utilized cut -d, -f, and -s. These were in the order. cut -d -s ',' -f 10
   I then piped this to sort and then piped that to uniq --count, which counted
   the "prefix lines by number of occurrences"
2. There are 7841 labels over 50K and 24720 less than or equal to 50K. I used
   cut -d ',' -f 15 adult.data | sort | uniq --count
3. There are White: 27816, Black: 3124, Asian Pacific Islander: 1039
   American Indian Eskimo: 311 and Others: 271. To get this I used again.
   cut -d -s ',' -f 9 adult.data before piping "|" it to sort --numeric-sort
   --reverse | uniq -c > results.data sort -nr results.data
4. There are White Males: 19174, While Females: 8642 Black Males: 1569,
   Black Females: 1555 Asian Pacific Islander Males: 693, Asian Pacifice Islander
   Females: 346, American Indian Eskimo Male: 192, American Indian Females: 119,
   Other Males: 162, and Other Females: 109 To get this I used again. cut -d -s ',' -f 9
   ,10 adult.data | sort --numeric-sort --reverse | uniq -c
   > results.data sort -nr results.data
