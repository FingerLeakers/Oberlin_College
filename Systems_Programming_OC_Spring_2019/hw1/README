=============================================
FILES ENCLOSED
=============================================
hello.c

Prints a formatted amalgam of strings and floating point numbers.

rot128.c

Encrypts text by rotating it a user inputted number of times.

diamond.c

The user enters a size for a "diamond" and such a diamond is printed.

Makefile

Compiles all of the files at once to reduce the burden on the user.

=============================================
ISSUES
=============================================
There are no warnings or compilation problems
=============================================
EXTRA CREDIT
=============================================
When ./diamond is run you can see that there are two diamonds
printed, one diamond and one diamond outline. This diamond outline
was for the extra credit, but I did not figure out how to read
a user's input as being a negative number. If the user enters
either a positive or negative number they will see both diamonds.
I am confused as to whether or not printing out both diamonds at
the same time goes against the objective of the non-extra-credit
portion. I do this under that the assumption that printing out both is \
OK.
