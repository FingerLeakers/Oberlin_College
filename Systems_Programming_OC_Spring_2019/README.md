### CSCI241 | Systems Programming | Oberlin College

Here I document my coursework for the Spring 2019 iteration of the CSCI 241. I have edited the labs to remove any imperfections in the code, though there still may exist some poor design decisions. I may occassionally update the labs to improve the code. If there are any faults that you see please contact me: tmartin2@oberlin.edu
