### CSCI995H | Topics in Deep Learning | Oberlin College

Here I document my coursework for the private reading called Topics in Deep Learning. I have edited the projects and practice to remove any imperfections in the code, though there still may exist some poor design decisions. I may occassionally update this work to improve the code and add comments. If there are any faults that you see please contact me: tmartin2@oberlin.edu
